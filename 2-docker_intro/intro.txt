DOCKER CONTAINERS AND IMAGES
    Virtual Machine is an emulation of a operating system
    Say we want to run a Windows application on a Mac OS, we need a Virtual Machine
    When running a VM you can tell it what hardware it has access to 

    Docker Containers are similar, but work more efficiently with less flexibility
    Usually run on a Linux system, due to using the Cloud 
    Each container uses the existing operating system and run as a process within that OS 
    Each container has its own storage and OS 

    The OS is made of two main parts
        KERNEL
            usually interacts with controls and hardware 
        FILES 
    
    Do not develop locally with MAC OS Containers, always use Linux
    To do this we use 
        Docker Desktop 
    It is inefficient but that is fine for local work 

    Docker Containers run everything except the KERNEL
    Theyre based on IMAGES which specify what is run inside the container when it runs

    DOCKER IMAGE is a snapshot of source code, libraries, tools etc except OS KERNEL
    Many pre-built images so we don't have to build from scracth 


DOCKER DESKTOP 
    IMAGES
        Create an Image to run a container 
        Go to our stores project 
        Restart terminal 
        In terminal type:
            docker 
        This gives access to Docker CLI we use this to create image 
        Create a Dockerfile (with said name)

DOCKER COMPOSE 
    allows us to start multiple containers at the same time
    create a file called
        docker-compose.yml 
    this is a default name that docker compose looks for, for configuration
    
DEBUG FLASK APPS W DOCKER IN VS code
    Set breakpoints by selecting line number
    Before we run this line the code will stop before the line
    Create a file:
        docker-compose.debug.yml
