------------------------------------- YOUR FIRST REST API -------------------------------------
REST API
    Receive requests from a client, and respond with some data
    Multiple applications/clients can make requests to the API 
    This particular API will:
        Create stores, each with a name, and list of stocked items
        Create an item within a store, each with name and price
        Retreive a list of all stores and their items
        Given its name, retreive an individual store and all items
        Given a store name, retreive only a list of items within it
    When creating a store we shall send a POST request to the following endpoint
        /store (it will have the following object/dict {"name": "My Store", "items": []})
    And when creating items, we send a POST request to the following endpoint:
        /store/store_name/item  (it will have the following {"name": "Chair", "price": 15})
    To retrieve all stores and their items we send a GET request 
    To get particular store we also use a GET request, but to a specific store endpoint

Initial FLASK Set-Up
    In Terminal run
        python3.10 -m venv .venv 
    To create a virtual environment 
    Now tell VS Code which virtual environment to use by
        cmd + shift + P 
        Python: Select Interpreter
        Find your one
        Restart terminal
    In our app.py we then:
        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__) # this is the last line of code 
    This creates a Flask app
    Any endpoints defined in this app, when we run the app it will make the endpoints available
    We do this with
        flask run
    In the terminal, which looks for a file called app.py and a variable called app
    We receive a warning which states that we should not use flask run when deploying the app
    It shows that it is being run on
        http://127.0.0.1:5000
    Which is where we will send our requests for data
    Pressing 
        ctrl + c 
    Stops the app

Your first API Endpoint 
    Define where we store our data (usually in a database), but for now use Py list

WHAT IS JSON
    REST API's usually work with JSON data 
    It is a long string of data
    The content needs to follow a context 
    Usually it is similar to a Py dictionary with a key-value pair 
    Having it "un-prettified" gives less data to transfer, therefore best to leave
    It is the data clients and servers use to interact

HOW TO INTERACT WITH AND TEST API
    This course makes us use the Insomnia program
    It is very similar to Postman but simpler 
    How to use:
        Create Project
        Create Collection (and name it)
        Plus Icon
        New HTTP Request 
        Make requests like GET, POST etc
        Enter url 
    Make sure flask app is running and hit SEND and see data
    Useful for making POST and other requests
    Saves in a new request that you should change name to more specific

CREATE STORES IN REST API   
    To create we will receive JSON data which has the store info
    We add this info to the list 
    Create a new Insomnia Request for a POST request 
    Create a POST request in app.py
    In Insomnia, go to your new POST HTTP request, and select BODY
    Select JSON format and put:
        {
            "name": "My Store 2"
        }
    When we send of the request it should now update accordingly. 

CREATE ITEMS IN REST API
    We will need the client to send a request to a specific store 
    Can use a QUERY PARAMETER to interpolate name eg
        http://127.0.0.1.5000/store?name=My Store


---------------------------------------NOTE---------------------------------------
Sometimes because of prev installations, it may not pick up python3.10.6
In that case, run   
    source .venv/bin/activate
And install what you need
