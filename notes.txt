REST API
    Receive requests from a client, and respond with some data
    Multiple applications/clients can make requests to the API 
    This particular API will:
        Create stores, each with a name, and list of stocked items
        Create an item within a store, each with name and price
        Retreive a list of all stores and their items
        Given its name, retreive an individual store and all items
        Given a store name, retreive only a list of items within it
    When creating a store we shall send a POST request to the following endpoint
        /store (it will have the following object/dict {"name": "My Store", "items": []})
    And when creating items, we send a POST request to the following endpoint:
        /store/store_name/item  (it will have the following {"name": "Chair", "price": 15})
    To retrieve all stores and their items we send a GET request 
    To get particular store we also use a GET request, but to a specific store endpoint

Initial FLASK Set-Up
    In Terminal run
        python3.10 -m venv .venv 
    To create a virtual environment 
    Now tell VS Code which virtual environment to use by
        cmd + shift + P 
        Python: Select Interpreter
        Find your one
        Restart terminal
    In our app.py we then:
        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__) # this is the last line of code 
    This creates a Flask app
    Any endpoints defined in this app, when we run the app it will make the endpoints available
    We do this with
        flask run
    In the terminal, which looks for a file called app.py and a variable called app
    We receive a warning which states that we should not use flask run when deploying the app
    It shows that it is being run on
        http://127.0.0.1:5000
    Which is where we will send our requests for data
    Pressing 
        ctrl + c 
    Stops the app
