REST API
    Receive requests from a client, and respond with some data
    Multiple applications/clients can make requests to the API 
    This particular API will:
        Create stores, each with a name, and list of stocked items
        Create an item within a store, each with name and price
        Retreive a list of all stores and their items
        Given its name, retreive an individual store and all items
        Given a store name, retreive only a list of items within it
    When creating a store we shall send a POST request to the following endpoint
        /store (it will have the following object/dict {"name": "My Store", "items": []})
    And when creating items, we send a POST request to the following endpoint:
        /store/store_name/item  (it will have the following {"name": "Chair", "price": 15})
    To retrieve all stores and their items we send a GET request 
    To get particular store we also use a GET request, but to a specific store endpoint
